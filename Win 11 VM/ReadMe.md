# Windows 11 VM in Hyper-V

## Pre-requisites

The following are things you must have before you can create a VM in Hyper-V, particularly a Windows 11 VM.

- Your physical computer MUST support TPM.
  - This is required for Windows 11.
- Your physical computer MUST be running a Pro/Enterprise version of Windows. Home editions will not work.

# How to Setup VM in Hyper-V

1. Make sure the Windows ISO is located in your Downloads folder. `"C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\`
2. Make sure the ISO file name matches what is in the `IsoPath` variable at the top of the script.
2. Run the `Win11VM.ps1` script as admin.
3. As long as it completes without errors, the window to start the VM should display.
4. Start the VM, and proceed with the insstall of Windows, you'll need to press a key to have it boot to the installation media.
5. DURING the install,
   1. If the Windows key being used it your own, initially login with your personal account so digital entitlement is assigned to you.

17. Turn "Enhanced session" back on.
18. Turn on Bitlocker.
19. If using your personal account, go to "Settings" > "Accounts" > "Access work or schoool" and connect your work/school account.

## Issue: Running Scripts Disabled

If you get an error about not being able to run the script because running scripts is disabled on this system there is an easy fix for this. The error will look similar to the one shown below:

```
File C:\Users\evilt\Desktop\repos\Hyper-V-VM-Scripts\Win 11 VM\Win11VM.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on 
this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```

The fix for that is to first run `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`. This will show you what your script execution policy is currently set to. If running scripts is disabled, you should get results like those below.

```
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine      Restricted
```

If you do, run the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force`, and then run the list command again to confirm it has changed. Your results should appear similar to those shown below:

```
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Get-ExecutionPolicy â€“List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    Unrestricted
```

Now run the VM creation script again. Barring any other issues, the script should run successfully now.

## Additional Recommended Installs

Links in this section must be accessed from within the VM or they will download to your physical machine. Unless of course, you shared a drive with your VM.
